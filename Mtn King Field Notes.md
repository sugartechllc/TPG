 - Added 2 qts. mineral to stop the evaporation that has been happening over the last week
 - Changed the autosample interval from 15s to 1min.
 - Changed tpg.py to use the LAST command rather than the MEAS command. 
   This command doesn't have the time lag of the MEAS command, and perhaps it will save a 
   little on power draw.
 - Reset the precip reading to 0.
